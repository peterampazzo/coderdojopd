# CoderDojo Padova

Currently under development.

### Development

This website is built with [react-static](https://react-static.js.org).

After you've cloned this repository, you need to install all the dependencies (make sure `yarn` is already installed):

```
yarn install
```

Now you can build the site and make it available on a local server with:

```
react-static start
```
